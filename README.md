# API Documentation

- This documentation serves as a comprehensive `guide` that empowers developers to `understand`, `interact` with, and `integrate` an `Application Programming Interface` (API) seamlessly into your applications.
- It includes essential details such as `authentication` methods, available `endpoints`, `request` and `response` formats, error handling, and `usage` examples.
- This API documentation simplifies the process of `leveraging` external services, fostering efficient and effective software development.

---

- ## SECTION 1

  - `Created By:` Selepe Sello
  - The `End` Goal is to Have the `same` API Implemented using `.NET 6`.

---

- ## SECTION 2

  ### These are the Default Users initially in the Database:

  - #### `Default User 1`:

    - `Name`: Test
    - `Surname`: User
    - `Email`: testuser@tuks.co.za
    - `Password`: @TestUser#564
    - `API_key`: a9198b68355f78830054c31a39916b7f
  - #### `Default User 2`:

    - `Name`: John
    - `Surname`: Doe
    - `Email`: johndoe3@gmail.com
    - `Password`: tEst@us5e#hd
    - `API_key`: K9yW8cGnE3qTfR7xV2sZ6bN1mJ4jL5p

---

- ## SECTION 3

  - All Requests to the `Database` should be Sent via `POST` method for security Purposes.
  - All `API` Request/Response bodies are in the Form of a `JSON` object.
  - The JSON Object Must contain the `type` attribute and some more data, this is so that the requests can be `distinguishable` and `handled` accordingly.
  - The `Database` in Question is a `MySQL` Database, Tool: `phpMyAdmin`.
  - The the `API_keys` on the `database` for sending `requests` to the API are included in `SECTION 1`.
  - #### `Note Well:`
    - All `SENSITIVE` data sent to the api like `passwords`, `usernames/emails` and etc will be `encrypted` from the client side first.
    - Then on the `API`, The Data will be `Decrypted` and `Handled` accordingly.
  - #### `Example Requests:`

- ## SECTION 4

  - ### Basic Setup Before Running/Interpreting the Codes

    - Import the `data` table using the datadb database dumb.
    - Import the `users` table using the usersdb database dumb, **OR ALTERNATIVELY**
    - Create another table called `users` with the following fields: "id", "name", "surname", "email", "password", "API_key", "salt".
    - The `id` field should be `Automatically` generated, Using `AUTO_INCREMENT=1`
    - ##### Testing Requirements:

      - At least Have Xampp installed
      - Copy the souce code to the httdoc directory
      - Run the `Apache` and `MySQL` server
      - url:  `"http://localhost/path/to/hack_api.php"`
      - method: `POST` - (HTTP method)
      - You may use PostMan to Test if the API Works:
        - Postman Installation/Tutorial:
          - Windows 10: [YouTube-Link](https://youtu.be/pBo_oClYjjM?feature=shared)
          - Windows 11: [YouTube-Link](https://youtu.be/pBo_oClYjjM?feature=shared)
      - You may/may not use the examples in `Section 2`

  - ### How the Sign Up and Login Works:

    - A User must have an account to view the Cars for practical 3, and all the other page.
    - If a `user` doesn't have an account they can only access the `signup`, `login` and `launch` pages.
    - So the `user` will have to `create an account` and `login`.
    - When a `user` submits the signup form, the `'required'` from HTML will make sure all fields are filled,
    - Then `JavaScript` will be loaded, And it will do signup validation on the `client side`.
    - Thereafter, If `javascript` is done, the form will be sent to `validate-signup.php` via `POST`.
    - This is to make sure the request is secured, Then `PHP` will do the validation on the `server side`.
    - Once all the validation is done, the user will be added to the 'users' database table, meaning they will have an account with `Jerman Otto`.
    - `Sign Up Instructions:`
      - All Fields SHOULD not be `Empty`
      - The `NAME` and `SURNAME` fields SHOULD contain only Characters
      - The `EMAIL` SHOULD contain `@gmail.com` or `@tuks.co.za`, and AT LEAST a Character on the LEFT.
      - Make sure the EMAIL doesn't contain `Illegal Characters`
      - Make sure the PASSWORD is at least `8 Characters` long and contains a `Number`, Contains a `Special Character`, `Uppercase` and `Lowercase` letters.
      - Make sure the PASSWORD doesn't contain Illegal Characters
      - The PASSWORD and CONFIRM PASSWORD SHOULD `match`
      - ###### This Is Implemented to make sure the Password is strong and it cannot be guessed or generated easily by Attackers using `Brute Force Attacks` and stuff.

  - ### How My Encryption Algorithm Works

    - Generate a `RANDOM` int, SALT value between `[2000000000, 2147483646]`.
    - Encrypt PASSWORD using the random number as the `salt` with `sha256` and `hash_pbkdf2` method, `hash_pbkdf2("sha256", p, s, i, b)`;
    - Using 1000 iterations for the hash_pbkdf2 method, and a HASH length of 32 BYTES, So that it can fit well into a column of this `size` => `VARCHAR(128)`.
    - Finally i `Concatenate` the `SALT` and `HASH` and the encode the resulting string to base 64, using `base64_encode()`.

    ---
  - ### API Key

    - The API key is a random string of `length=32`.
    - It Contains these `AlphaNumeric` Characters: `0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`
    - The Key is then Displayed to the User using a `<p>` tag in every file right after the Heading.
